# Simpllo - UI Presentation

The product uses a simple and intuitive interface divided into containers:

- âœ… The `Navigation Bar` used to control the project (Clear, Preview, Download, and Deploy)
- âœ… Builder, Left Panel where all the available components exist grouped in categories 
- âœ… The Center Area is used to edit the pages and interact with the components
- âœ… Builder, Right Panel shows the properties for active components and Page Globals

This simple structure allows to `drag & drop` components from the `LEFT` Sidebar into the center area where the content is created. 

Once a component is dropped in the editor, the user can change the position in the view, customize the appearence of any element and preview the changes. 

## âœ… LEFT Panel - `Components`

The sidebar uses a collapsable structure where the components are grouped in categories: 

- `Grids`: for layout control 
- `Navigation` bars
- `Common` elements like buttons and alerts
- `Cards` 
- `Footers`  
- `Contact` forms

## âœ… Center Area - `Page Edits`

In the center area of the builder, the user can interact with the content by changing the position, adding and deleting components, and changing the styling for each element. 

The active component is highlighted using a dotted border and the RIGHT panel automatically shows all editable properties.
